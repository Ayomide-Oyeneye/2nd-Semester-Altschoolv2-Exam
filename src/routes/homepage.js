      <p>This project is a simple React application that demonstrates the creation of a custom counter hook with functions for increment, decrement, reset, and setting a value. It also includes a user interface for the counter. Additionally, it implements routing for different pages, including a custom counter page, a 404 page for handling unknown routes, and a page to test error boundary handling. This project serves as a basic example of managing state and navigation in a React application.</p>

# Custom Counter App with React

This is a simple React application that demonstrates the usage of a custom counter hook. It also includes a 404 page and a page to test the error boundary.

## Features

1. Custom Counter Hooks ;

   The custom counter hook, useCounter.js, provides the following functions:

- Increment the counter (increases the number value by 1)
- Decrement the counter (decreases the number value by 1)
- Reset the counter (reset the number value to 0)
- Set a specific value for the counter to 10
- 404 Page
- Error boundary testing

2. Routes;
   /: The home page.
   /counter: The counter page
   /error: A page to test the error boundary.
   FourzeroFourPage: When accessing a non-existent route.
